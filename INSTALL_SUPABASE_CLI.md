# üîß Install Supabase CLI - Windows Quick Fix

The npm installation doesn't work anymore. Here are the working methods:

---

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Via Scoop (EASIEST - Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Scoop (if you don't have it)

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

### Step 2: Install Supabase CLI

```powershell
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```powershell
supabase --version
```

You should see: `supabase version X.X.X`

---

## ‚úÖ Method 2: Direct Download (Manual)

### Step 1: Download

1. Go to: https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases/latest
2. Download: `supabase_windows_amd64.zip`
3. Extract to: `C:\supabase\`

### Step 2: Add to PATH

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Administrator
$path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'Machine')
$newPath = $path + ';C:\supabase'
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', $newPath, 'Machine')
```

### Step 3: Restart PowerShell

Close and reopen PowerShell, then verify:

```powershell
supabase --version
```

---

## ‚úÖ Method 3: Via Chocolatey (Alternative)

If you have Chocolatey installed:

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Administrator
choco install supabase
```

---

## üöÄ After Installation

Once Supabase CLI is installed, run the setup script:

```powershell
.\setup-supabase.ps1
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" after installation

**Solution**: Restart PowerShell completely (close all windows and reopen)

### Permission denied during installation

**Solution**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

### Scoop installation fails

**Solution**: Check your execution policy
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
# Should be RemoteSigned or Unrestricted

# If not, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Install (Copy-Paste)

**If you trust Scoop (recommended):**

```powershell
# Install Scoop
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

# Install Supabase CLI
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase

# Verify
supabase --version
```

**Then run:**

```powershell
.\setup-supabase.ps1
```

---

## üìù What Happens Next

After CLI is installed, `setup-supabase.ps1` will:

1. ‚úÖ Log you into Supabase (opens browser)
2. ‚úÖ Show your projects
3. ‚úÖ Link to your project
4. ‚úÖ Push migrations (creates 14 tables)
5. ‚úÖ Add seed data (6 products, 3 coupons)
6. ‚úÖ Update .env.local
7. ‚úÖ Start dev server

---

## üéØ Recommended Path

```powershell
# 1. Install Scoop (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

# 2. Install Supabase CLI
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase

# 3. Run setup script
.\setup-supabase.ps1
```

**Total time: ~5 minutes**
