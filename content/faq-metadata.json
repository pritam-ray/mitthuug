        "answer": "Our bites are crafted with just two primary ingredients: premium roasted sesame seeds and organic jaggery. The Cardamom variant includes green cardamom powder, and the Almond variant features California almonds. That's it — no refined sugar, no preservatives, no artificial flavors. Just pure, traditional goodness.",
